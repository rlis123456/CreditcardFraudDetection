# CreditcardFraudDetection
Project to Detect Fraud from Transactions
 **Dataset**: Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Project Scope**: Identify fraudulent transactions in a dataset with highly imbalanced classes.
- **Skills Highlighted**: Anomaly detection, imbalanced data handling, performance metrics.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach a **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project, along with suggested datasets and methodologies.

---

### 1. **Get the Dataset**

- **Download** the dataset from [Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](http://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). This dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Inspect the Dataset**: It has 284,807 transactions, with only 492 labeled as fraud (about 0.17%), making it highly imbalanced.

---

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

- **Data Cleaning**: Since this dataset is anonymized, you don’t need to deal with personally identifiable information. However, check for any missing or null values (even though this dataset is generally clean).
- **Feature Scaling**: Use **StandardScaler** to scale the 'Amount' feature, as most columns are already standardized.
- **Split the Data**: Divide the dataset into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%) for model evaluation.

---

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- **Class Imbalance Check**: Visualize the distribution of fraud vs. non-fraud transactions. The data will be heavily skewed, highlighting the need for specific strategies to handle this imbalance.
- **Feature Correlation**: Use **correlation heatmaps** to check relationships between features, which might provide insights into feature selection.
- **Visualize Distributions**: Plot distributions for features like 'Amount' and 'Time' to see if any obvious patterns emerge.

---

### 4. **Handle Class Imbalance**

- **Oversampling Techniques**: Use **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)** to create synthetic samples for the minority (fraud) class.
- **Undersampling Techniques**: Alternatively, you could down-sample the majority class (non-fraud) transactions to balance the classes.
- **Class Weight Adjustment**: Adjust the class weight in your model to make it more sensitive to fraud transactions (e.g., using the `class_weight='balanced'` parameter in some models).

---

### 5. **Build and Train Models**

- **Baseline Models**:
    - **Logistic Regression**: Set up a baseline with logistic regression. Be sure to use `class_weight='balanced'`.
    - **Decision Tree**: Use decision trees, as they are less sensitive to imbalance.
    - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Can be effective in anomaly detection but may struggle with large datasets.
- **Advanced Models**:
    - **Random Forest**: Good for handling imbalanced data and can provide feature importance insights.
    - **Gradient Boosting**: Techniques like XGBoost and LightGBM often perform well on imbalanced data.
    - **Autoencoders**: Use deep learning for anomaly detection, where you train an autoencoder on the non-fraud data and flag unusual patterns as fraud.

---

### 6. **Evaluate Model Performance**

- **Performance Metrics**: Use precision, recall, F1-score, and **ROC-AUC** to evaluate the models.
    - **Precision**: Important to ensure that flagged transactions are indeed frauds.
    - **Recall**: Measures how well the model identifies actual fraudulent cases.
    - **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall, giving an overall metric of model performance.
    - **Confusion Matrix**: Analyze TP, TN, FP, FN counts to see how well the model handles fraud detection.
    - **ROC-AUC Curve**: Visualize the trade-off between true positives and false positives.

---

### 7. **Optimize the Model**

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV** to fine-tune hyperparameters for models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
- **Threshold Adjustment**: Adjust the probability threshold for labeling transactions as fraud, aiming for an optimal balance of precision and recall.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine models in an ensemble to leverage the strengths of different algorithms.

---

### 8. **Deploy the Model (Optional)**

- **Streamlit** or **Flask API**: Create a simple web app that accepts transaction data and provides a fraud score.
- **Dashboard**: Build a dashboard with visualizations and predictions to demonstrate model output, which could be valuable in a real-world scenario.

---

### Suggested Tools & Libraries

- **Libraries**: Python with **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-Learn**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Imbalanced-learn** (for SMOTE), and **XGBoost**.
- **Deployment**: Use Streamlit for a simple interface, or a Flask/Django API if you’re deploying to the web.
